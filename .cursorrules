# Yaseen Website - Cursor Configuration

This is a React + Vite project for a personal digital assistant website.

## Project Structure
- React 19 with JSX
- Vite build tool (using rolldown-vite)
- React Router for client-side routing
- Component-based architecture with pages/ and components/ directories
- CSS modules for styling

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, modern UI with neutral color palette

## Key Files
- `src/App.jsx` - Main app component with routing
- `src/pages/` - Page components (Home, Services, About, Contact, etc.)
- `src/components/` - Reusable components (Header, Footer)
- `src/index.css` - Global styles and CSS variables

## Import Patterns
- Use relative imports for local files
- React Router components: `import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom'`
- CSS imports: `import './ComponentName.css'`
